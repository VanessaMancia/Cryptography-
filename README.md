## One of the main goals of Cryptography is to ensure the confidentiality (data remains private), integrity(data is not tampered), and authenticity of data (data source is verified). This is achieved by making data in an unreadable format. How does data turn into an unreadable format? Good question. This is achieved by turning plain text data into ciphertext using algorithms and keys.
